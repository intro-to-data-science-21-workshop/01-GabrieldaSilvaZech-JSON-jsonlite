# Working with JSON and jsonlite


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to JSON data formats and working with these using the jsonlite package for R. JSON is a type of data that allows users to transmit and serialize structured data (e.g. between a server and web applications) in a more human readable syntax. The jsonlite package provides useful functions to read, prepare and export that data in a consistent way in R.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about JSON data, (2) show you the working of and the main functions of the jsonlite package, and (3) show you how to use jsonlite and other tidyverse packages to transform JSON data into tidy data frames (e.g. to use in data analysis).
